- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SteveHampson71

<i>I'm new to Git and GitHub, just learning the ropes</i>

Systems developer for 20 years<br>
Suffered from severe depression for 10 years<br>
Retraining in web development

I'm building a demo website to collect what I'm learning along the way, to help me learn by doing,<br>
and to reinforce the learning by writing, and to help others looking to start out in web development.

You can visit here:

or I'll be loading onto Git once I'm more familiar with the environment.
